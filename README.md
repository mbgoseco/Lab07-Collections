# Lab07-Collections

## Description
This app demonstrates the use of enums and collections to create a deck of playing cards for a "dealer" that is then evenly distributed among two players. The app will display how many cards are in each deck, what kinds, and when they are added and removed from each deck.

## Directions
When run, the app will activate a console that displays the deck built for the dealer. Then it will show how many cards were given to each player from the dealer, then show the dealer's remaining cards (if any). The console will also display individual cards being added and removed from each deck. No user input is required.
